    <h1>Using the Xero Scouting System</h1>
    <h4>Xero Scouting System Devices</h4>
    There are three types of devices in the Xero Scouting System.  These are the XeroCentral,
    the XeroScout, and the XeroCoach.
    <h5>XeroCentral</h5>
    This is the central device that contains all of the scouting data.  This device creates and
    manages the event, including sychronization with all of the other types of devices.
    <br>
    <h5>XeroScout</h5>
    This is the device a scouter uses.  A XeroScout device can be used to scout another team or used
    to scout a match.  Scouting assignments are given when a XeroScout device is first synchronized with the
    XeroCentral device.  Subsequent synchronization operations moves the scouting data from the XeroScout
    device into the database on the XeroCentral device.
    <br>
    <h5>XeroCoach</h5>
    The XeroCoach device contains a complete copy of the scouting data, like the XeroCentral device.  However
    this data is (mostly) read only.  The XeroCoach device is used by the team coach when reviewing strategy
    with other alliances about how to approach a match.  Note, the XeroCoach device can connect to the Blue Alliance
    site to download match scoring data or zebra data.  If this data is downloaded, it is transferred to the
    XereCentral device the next time these device synchronize.
    <br>
    <h4>Synchronization</h4>
    Synchronization is the process of moving data from one device in the Xero Scouting System to another.  Synchronization
    can occur over BlueTooth, TCP/IP, or USB.  Before running synchronization, be sure to set the Team Number of the team using
    the Settings/Set Team Number menu item.
    <h5>USB</h5>
    USB synchronization happens over a special data transfer cable.  This cable can be found on amazon via the link below.  Once
    the two devices are connected via the USB cable, they can be syncronized via the Synchronize/USB Sync menu item.

    <br><br>
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OTPVMY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Pluggable Cable</a>"
    <br>
    <h5>TCP/IP</h5>
    TCP synchronization does data transfer using the machines TCP/IP network.  This could be WIFI or a hardwired Ethernet
    connection.  There are two options here. Network Synchronization (Automatic) works on most environments.  With automoatic
    synchronization, the XeroScout device is constantly looking for a beacon that is broadcast from the XeroCentral device
    advertizing that it is a central devices for the desired team.  This beacon provides the IP address of the XeroCentral
    device and the XeroScouting device can connect.
    <br>
    If the XeroScout device does not see the XeroCentral beacon, the Network Synchronization (Direct) can be used.  With direct
    synchronization, an IP address must be entered.  This IP address can be found at the bottom status bar of the XeroCentral
    application.
    <br>
    Note, WIFI is illegal in the stands at an event.  It interfers with the robots or the FTA systems on the field.  If TCP/IP
    synchronization is to be used in the stands, it must be hardwired Ethernet.  This generally requires a router of some type
    serving DHCP addresses (or statically assigned IP addresses for devices).  This in turn requires some way to power a router
    in the stands.  This gets to be complicated and prone to failures.  The USB cable method is highly recommended for synchronization
    in the stands of an event.
    <br>

    <h5>BlueTooth</h5>
    For two devices to synchronize using Bluetooth, the devices must first be paried.  Under Windows 10 this is accomplished
    using the Settings/Devices window.  Select "Add Bluetooth or other device" and follow the prompts.  Once the two devices
    are paried, Bluetooth synchronization is started using the Synchronization/Bluetooth menu item.
    <br>
    Note, Bluetooth synchronization is the least reliable way to synchronize.  In addition, Bluetooth operates on the 2.4 GHz
    frequency range which, while can interfer with the 2.4 Ghz WIFI at an event.  Currently, there is no explicit rule against
    Bluetooth (that I have seen), but its used in less than ideal.  It is highly recommended that the USB synchronization be used
    at events.

    <a name="create_event"></a>
    <h2>Create A New Event</h2>
    A new event is created via the File/New Event menu item.  Selecting this menu item
    will display a New Event Wizard.  You must be connected to the internet to create a
    new event as the initial event data is downloaded from the Blue Alliance web site.
    <h4>Select Event</h4>
    On this page, select an event from the Blue Alliance database. Double click on the
    event to select it.
    <h4>Select Forms</h4>
    On this page, select the team scouting and the match scouting forms.  These files are
    scouting forms defined in XeroScout JSON format.  This format should be described in
    an accompying document.
    <h4>Tablet Scouting Pool</h4>
    On this page the set of tablets used for scouting is defined. In the Table Pool column
    you can add a new table by pressing the Insert key.  You can delete a table by selecting
    the table and pressing the Delete key.<br>
    Once a set of tables is defined, drag tables from the Tablet Pool column to the Team Scout
    List column and the Match Scout List Column. You must have at least one tablet in the Team
    Scout List and six tablets in the Match Scout List to move forward.
    <br>
    Once the wizard is complete, the program reads the team list from the Blue Alliance web site.
    If the match schedule is available, it will also be downloaded, but this is not required at this
    stage.
    <br>
    At this point, the tablets assigned to team scouting are assigned to their respective teams.  The
    Team Scouting Status window will show the team scouting tablet assignments.
    <br>
    Once all data is downloaded from the Blue Alliance site, you will be prompted to save the event.  At
    this point, no more internet access is required unless you are getting Key Performance Indicators,
    Blue Alliance scoring data or Blue Alliance Zebra data.
    <br>

    <a name="download_kpi"></a>
    <h2>Getting Key Performance Indicators From Blue Alliance</h2>
    Key Performance Indicators is data about the performance of each robot in the current event, based
    on previous events in the same year.  Getting this data involves determining every event a team has
    participated in for each team in the current event.  Then all of the event data for each of these
    additional events is retreived.  Finally all of this previou data is processed.  For each entry
    in the scoring breakdown data from Blue Alliance, an average value is calculcated and added to the
    team data for each team.

    <br>
    <hr>
    <a name="download_matches"></a>
    <h2>Download Match Schedule</h2>
    Once the match schedule is made available on the Blue Alliance, the match schedule can be downloaded.
    The match schedule is generally made available (at least for the PNW district events) the night of
    load-in as soon as all teams have checked in.  It does no harm to try and download the match schedule
    and if the schedule it not available, a message is displayed.
    <br>
    At this point, the tablets assigned to match scouting are assigned to their respective matches.  The
    Match Scouting Status window will show the match scouting tablet assignments.

    <br>
    <hr>
    <a name="sync_scouting"></a>
    <h2>Synchronizing with a Scouting Tablet</h2>
    To start the scouting process, a XeroScout tablet must be sychronized with the XeroCentral device.
    Devices can be sychronized via USB, TCP/IP or Bluetooth.  The first time a XeroScout devices is synchronized
    with the XeroCentral device, the XeroScout devices picks a table identity.  This identity was established
    on the XeroCentral device when the event being scouted was created.  Each tablet identity is assigned a set
    scouting assignments, either team scouting assignments or match scouting assignments.  After the initial
    synchronization, these assignments are avaiable on the XeroScout device.
